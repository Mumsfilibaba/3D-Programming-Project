# 3D-Programming-Project
This is my final project in the 3D Programming course at BTH (DV1542) taken during my second year.

The application compiles for Windows and supports both DirectX 11 and OpenGL (The API used is toggable with a define in Main.cpp). 

**Features:** 
* Normal mapping
* Parallax Occlusion Mapping
* PCF Soft Shadows (Directional Light)
* Deferred Rendering
* Physically Based Rendering (With Image Based Lightning)
* Tesselation for terrain (Used together with heightmapping)
* Geometry Shader back face culling
